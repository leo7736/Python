# Exploring US Accidents Data: Unveiling Patterns and Insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) represents an approach in data analysis that encompasses a range of techniques, primarily graphical, aimed at achieving the following objectives:

*Gaining deep insights into the dataset

*Identifying underlying structures within the data

*Extracting essential variables

*Detecting outliers and anomalies

*Testing foundational assumptions

*Developing concise models

*Establishing optimal factor configurations

EDA is a fundamental process involving initial investigations into data, to discover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions. This process leverages summary statistics and visual representations.

The graphical methods used in EDA are often elegantly simple, encompassing techniques such as:

Visualizing raw data through histograms, probability plots, data traces, histograms, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots
Representing basic statistics like mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots derived from raw data
Arranging these plots strategically to harness natural pattern-recognition abilities, often employing multiple plots per page.
Applying EDA to US Accidents:
The analysis delves into five years' worth of road accident data within the United States, serving as a potential avenue for accident prevention.

Key Insights from the Analysis:

1. Population's Impact on Accidents:

Accidents are influenced by population density.

2. City-Based Accident Trends:

The accident count per city follows an exponential decline.
About 5% of cities experience over 1000 accidents annually.
Curiously, over 1200 cities report only one accident, warranting further investigation.

3. Temporal Patterns:

Weekdays witness a higher accident frequency compared to weekends.
During weekdays, accidents peak between 6 am and 10 am, while weekends show a peak between 10 am and 6 pm.

4. Yearly Trends:

An upward trajectory in accidents has been observed over the years.
The year 2020 recorded the highest accident count.

5. Seasonal Variation:

Accidents are most frequent from September to December.

6. Geographic Influence:

Coastal regions experience a higher occurrence of accidents compared to landlocked areas.
The application of EDA to US accident data not only unveils these valuable insights but also potentially contributes to accident prevention strategies. By comprehensively understanding accident patterns, stakeholders can work towards making roads safer and more secure.
