## EDA on zomato dataset

As part of this project, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of restaurants from Zomato, a popular online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. I used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to clean, transform, and visualize the data and gain insights into the restaurant market.
Some of the key findings from this project include:

🍽️ The most popular cuisines in the dataset are North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food.

🏙️ Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Bangalore have the highest number of restaurants, with Bangalore having the most diverse restaurant options.

🌟 Restaurants with higher ratings tend to have more votes and are located in areas with higher population densities.
