Excited to share that I've just completed an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project on Google Play Store analysis using Jupyter! 🚀📊

As part of this project, I analyzed a large dataset of apps from the Google Play Store and used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization tasks. I explored different aspects of the app market, such as categories, ratings, reviews, and installs, and gained valuable insights into what makes a successful app.

Some of the key findings from this project include:

📈 The top three app categories by number of installs are communication, social, and video players & editors.

👍 Higher ratings and more reviews tend to correlate with higher app installs, but there are some exceptions.

📉 Most apps have relatively low ratings (around 4 stars), but there are some outliers with extremely high or low ratings.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice my data analysis skills and learn more about the Google Play Store ecosystem.
